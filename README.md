# Multi-Client Chat Application (Java, Console-Based)

**Technologies:** Java, Socket Programming, Multithreading, Collections

## 📖 Overview
This is a real-time, console-based chat application developed in Java that allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and exchange messages simultaneously. The project demonstrates core concepts of Java networking, multithreading, and collection handling.

## 🚀 Features
- Multi-client support using socket connections.
- Each client runs on its own thread, enabling simultaneous communication.
- Graceful client disconnection and robust server-side error handling.
- Simple command-line interface for both server and clients.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Socket Programming**: For client-server communication.
- **Multithreading**: To handle multiple client connections concurrently.
- **Collections Framework**: To manage active client sockets.
